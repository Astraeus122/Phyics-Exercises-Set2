# Physics Programming Exercises (Set 2)

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the **Physics Programming Exercises - Second Set** for the GD2P02 module at Media Design School. The exercises aim to implement advanced physics concepts using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**, showcasing real-time rendering and simulations in **C++**.

## Assignment Details

- **Component Name:** GD2P02 - Physics Programming
- **Assessment Name:** Exercises - Second Set

### Structure

The second set of exercises includes three main exercises, which contain multiple sub-exercises (e.g., Exercise 002.1, Exercise 002.2, etc.). Each sub-exercise is implemented as a separate project under a single Visual Studio solution file. Precompiled release builds and debug builds are provided for all completed sub-exercises.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

|-- GD2P02_Assessment_2 |-- Exercise1/ |-- SubExercise1/ |-- Source Files (.cpp, .h) |-- Release/ |-- Debug/ |-- SubExercise2/ |-- Exercise2/ |-- ... |-- Exercise3/ 
|-- Include/ (SFML headers) |-- Lib/ (SFML libraries) |-- .sln (Solution File) |-- README.md (This file)

## Requirements to Run

### Prerequisites

To build and run the projects, you will need:
- **Visual Studio** (recommended version: 2019 or later)
- SFML libraries (provided in `Include/` and `Lib/` folders)

### Steps to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Astraeus122/Physics-Exercises.git
    cd Phyics-Exercises-Set2
    ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Select the desired project (sub-exercise) from the Solution Explorer.
4. Choose `Release` or `Debug` build configuration.
5. Build the project (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) and run it (`F5`).

### Release Builds

Precompiled release builds for all completed sub-exercises are included in the `Release` folder of each sub-exercise directory.
